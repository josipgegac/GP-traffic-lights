Create conda environment:
```shell
conda env create --file package-list.yml
```
These exact versions of all SUMO related packages, as well as version 1.20.0 of SUMO simulator
are required in order to have the exact same results when running simulations.
Other versions will have similar, but slightly different results.

Additionally install package graphviz for tree visualisations. Good luck.
